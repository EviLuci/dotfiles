## Introduction

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This collection contains my personal configuration files and scripts for setting up a customized Hyprland environment on Arch Linux. The aim is to streamline the process of replicating my setup on new systems.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is a newbie setup. So "Heads Up", Everything won't work out of the box
